Final Year Project

This is the github repository for my final year project that I carried out for university

It is a tool that teaches people their first 20 hours of programming

Although it is not complete there is a wide range of functionality built in to the software

The software is built using windows forms and c# to deliver a user interfact for the users to interact with and learn from

The software dynamically compiles code written by the user to allow them to test code on the fly and as part of tests built in to the program itself

It also connects to a database to pull in information which is used to carry out the tasks
